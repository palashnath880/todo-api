# Todo API

First of all clone this GitHub repository. Then open cmd on this project and run `npm install` command. 
After that set up your environment variable open the `.env` file on your code editor then set up the PORT, DB_USER, and DB_PASS values. Basically, I used MongoDB as a database.

Finally, run the command `node index.js` for the run server.

`Thank you`
